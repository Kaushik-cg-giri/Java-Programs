count character in string

1)Initialize String
2)set count=0
3)convert string to character array
4)iterate array
5)get the repeating character  number stored in count variable
		count = map.getOrDefault(ch,0)
	//it will return each character deafult value
	//if character not present return 0 
	//if character presnt more than one time the  las value return
	//any way first time each character default value is 0 as return as count
	//if a character comes 1 time and stored  it in map 
		then agin count return as 1
	
6)       map.put(ch,count+1)
	//it will store each character count
	//if first character default value is 0 it incremented to 1
	  if that character come agin it value incremented to1+1

   such way we store each character as key and its count as value
