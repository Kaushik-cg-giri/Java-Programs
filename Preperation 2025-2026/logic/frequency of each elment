frequency of each elemnt

1)initialize array
2)crate new array with the length of first array
3)initiale variable count to 1 store frequency of each elemnt
4)initialize variable k to 0
5)first take one  elemnt from  array and test how many time it will repeat that achieved through 2 loops
6)first loop for taking elemnt from array
7) second loop testing how many time it repeating
8)if elemnt repeat  check using arr[i] == arr[j]
9)increase count variable
10)set arr[j]=-1
11)outside inner loop store count to new array newArr
12)increment k
13)print newArr
14)if newArr value not -1 it will display
